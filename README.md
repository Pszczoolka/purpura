# enhanced default
A BetterDiscord theme based off of mobile Discord, with enhancements here and there.

**Features**
- Combines Stickers, Gif, and Emoji button into one
- Takes a mobile, multipanel look
- Removes the new display font "Ginto" and replaces it with a more bearable "Commissioner"
- Makes roles round again
- Rounds various elements a little more, including buttons, dropdowns, modals, and inputs.
- Looks much better with Windows Discord's title bar

**Images**
(Please Note: the images are slightly distorted, Discord's new blurple looks purple in my screenshots for some reason, and this theme does not change the accent color. Sorry about that.)
